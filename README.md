# TindrUnblur - See who likes you for free accounts
<br>

## NOTE: Tinder stopped blurring images client side making this extension obsolate
<br>

A chrome extension to disable blur overlay in Tinder 'Who likes you' web page. Makes sense only for free accounts.

Thanks Tinder for bluring previews clientside ;) 

1. Get the latest release: https://github.com/rursache/TindrUnblur/releases/latest
2. Install the extension in Chrome (drag the folder in chrome://extensions/ )
3. Open https://tinder.com/app/likes-you to see the magic
